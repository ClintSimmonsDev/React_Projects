      <p>Alluscion is a passionate painter who draws inspiration from the animal and spirit realm to create her beautiful works of art. Growing up surrounded by nature, Allison developed a deep connection with the world around her and the animals that inhabit it. She believes that there is a mystical and spiritual energy present in all living things, and seeks to capture that essence in her art.<br/>

      Through her use of bold colors and intricate details, Alluscion brings to life the creatures of her imagination and invites viewers into a world of wonder and enchantment. She sees her paintings as a way of bridging the gap between the physical and spiritual realms, and hopes that her work will inspire others to connect with the natural world and themselves, in a deeper and more meaningful way.</p>
